### In Progress
- Planning and tracking document (this file)

### Pending (MVP-critical)
- Dashboard status badges and checks
- Documentation updates and sample CSV
- Optional unit tests for generation and seeding
- Optional: Finals best-of-3 series support (best_of_3_single_elim)

## MVP Decisions and Assumptions
- Players CSV (header-based, UTF-8):
  - Doubles: `seeded_player_name,second_player_name`
  - Team-name tournaments: `seeded_player_name,team_name`
- Pool sizes supported for templates/generation: 4, 5
- Bracket formats: single_elimination and best_of_3_single_elim (finals)
- Tiebreakers priority: head_to_head, set_ratio, point_diff, random

## Roadmap and Acceptance Criteria

### Phase B — Admin Foundations
1. Players Import (AdminPlayersImport.vue)
   - CSV upload with header support and de-duplication (case-insensitive)
   - Bulk insert: teams rows with seeded_player_name and full_team_name computed from doubles/team-name columns
   - Manual add/remove/edit row UI
   - Acceptance: Duplicates prevented; invalid CSV errors shown; rows persist to DB

2. Pools and Seeds (AdminPoolsSeeds.vue)
   - Pools CRUD: name, court_assignment stored in [pools](supabase/schema.sql)
   - Drag and drop teams into pools; assign seed_in_pool with per-pool uniqueness (enforced by teams_pool_seed_uidx)
   - Visual validation for missing or duplicate seeds
   - Acceptance: Pool assignment and seeds persist; no seed conflicts; UX reflects errors

### Phase C — Pool Play UX
4. Generate Schedule UI (AdminGenerateSchedule.vue or dashboard card)
   - Button triggers [checkPrerequisites()](src/lib/schedule.ts:36); if ok calls [generateSchedule()](src/lib/schedule.ts:76)
   - Disable until prerequisites met; surface missing templates per pool size and missing team naming
   - Guard against duplicates: if pool matches exist, prompt to confirm overwrite or block
   - Acceptance: Matches inserted per templates; errors clear; no accidental duplicates

5. Public Nested Pool Play UX
   - Landing after access: if [Tournament.status](src/types/db.ts:52) = pool_play => show Pools list; if = bracket => show Bracket
   - Pools list page links to Pool details
   - Pool details: standings on top computed per [AdvancementRules](src/types/db.ts) tiebreakers; schedule below ordered by round_number; display ref team.
   - Match actions: after tapping a match, present one option:
     - Enter Score Manually (live score recording is deferred and hidden)
   - Acceptance: Users navigate via Pools -> Pool -> Match -> Action; standings update reactively on score changes.

6. Post-bracket edit warning
   - In [submitScore()](src/pages/ScoreEntry.vue:82) show non-blocking toast when bracket exists or status is bracket
   - Acceptance: Warning appears under condition; no scoring block

### Phase D — Bracket Play
7. Bracket Engine (src/lib/bracket.ts)
   - computePoolStandings(tournamentId)
   - seedAdvancers(advancementRules, standings) for pool sizes 4, 5; global rank winners then runners-up; total advancers N=2×pools; choose bracket size B in {2,4,8} = next power of two; award byes to top seeds
   - generateBracket(tournamentId): create matches with match_type=bracket, bracket_round; set tournaments.status='bracket' and bracket_generated_at; keep bracket_started=false until a bracket match goes live or is scored
   - rebuildBracket(tournamentId): allowed only when bracket_started=false; else block with message
   - Support final series best_of_3 by creating multiple final matches and resolving series winner (optional, future)
   - Acceptance: Correct number of bracket matches; seeding correct with byes; guard enforced on rebuild

8. Admin Bracket (AdminBracket.vue)
   - Generate, Rebuild, Manual Mode toggle
   - Manual slot editing for team1_id and team2_id per bracket match
   - Acceptance: Actions persist; visual bracket list accurate

### Phase E — Polish and Docs
9. Dashboard Checks and Badges
   - Templates coverage for pool sizes in use
   - Team naming completeness
   - Seeding completeness (no null seeds when pooled)
   - Pool schedule generated status
   - Bracket status and generated time
   - Acceptance: All badges reflect live DB state

10. Documentation and Samples
   - README: setup, Supabase env, RLS notes, sample CSV
   - Acceptance: A new dev can set up and run MVP following README only

11. Unit Tests (optional but recommended)
   - schedule mapping from templates
   - tiebreaker scenarios for standings
   - Acceptance: tests pass locally in CI or dev env

## Roles and Access
- Admin-only pages: protected by router meta requiresAdmin in [src/router/index.ts](src/router/index.ts)
- Public: score entry requires ensureAnon session in [src/stores/session.ts](src/stores/session.ts). Live scoreboard is disabled (deferred).

## Risks and Mitigations
- RLS Write Access: score and admin writes depend on authenticated role; ensure [ensureAnon()](src/stores/session.ts:54) runs before write flows
- Duplicate Generation: mitigate with explicit overwrite confirmation; consider a generation marker
- Tiebreaker Edge Cases: test head_to_head triangles and set_ratio ties; include fallback to random as last resort
- Bracket Best-of-3 Finals: clearly represent series in UI; optionally group final matches by series id

## Open Questions (tracked)
- Do we need per-court scheduling preferences or constraints beyond templates for MVP
- Should manual bracket mode allow creating byes explicitly or auto-place by default
